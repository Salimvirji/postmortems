The Order Management System (OMS) provided to Zerodha, a stock broker, collapsed when an order for 1M units of a penny stock was divided into more than 0.1M individual trades against the typical few hundreds, triggering a collapse of the OMS, which was not encountered prior by its provider - Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters), a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange.
