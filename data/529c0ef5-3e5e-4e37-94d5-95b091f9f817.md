In 2013, a temporary network partition in the redis cluster used for billing operations, caused a massive resynchronization from slaves. The overloaded master crashed and when it was restarted, it started up in read-only mode. The auto-recharge component in This resulted in failed transactions from Twilio's auto-recharge service, which unfortunately billed the customers before updating their balance internally. So the auto-recharge system continued to retry the transaction again and again, resulting in multiple charges to customer's credit cards.
