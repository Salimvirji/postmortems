FirstEnergy had a local failure when some transmission lines hit untrimmed foliage. The normal process is to have an alarm go off, which causes human operators to re-distribute power. But the GE system that was monitoring this had a bug which prevented the alarm from getting triggered, which eventually caused a cascading failure that eventually affected 55 million people.
