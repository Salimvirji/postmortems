    <p class="lh-copy">This project means to create a public repository of incident reports with annotated metadata and
        summaries of public postmortem
        documents. This repo takes the work in <a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems">danluu/post-mortems</a>
        repository
        and expands on it, trying to add categories, time data, and room for more in-depth analysis.</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">If you'd like to contribute, either edit a postmortem file in the data folder, or try to fix an
        issue.</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">The repository is <a href="https://github.com/icco/postmortems">available</a> on Github.</p>
