# postmortems

This repo means to create a public repository of postmortems with annotated metadata and summaries of public postmortem documents. This repo takes the work in https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems and expands on it, trying to add categories, time data, and room for more in-depth analysis.

The goal is to generate a pretty looking website that has search functionality to make it easier to analyze large sets of postmortems. Right now we're just fleshing out the metadata, the next step is generation.
