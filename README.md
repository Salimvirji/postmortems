# postmortems

This repo means to create a public repository of postmortems with annotated metadata and summaries of public postmortem documents. This repo takes the work in https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems and expands on it, trying to add categories, time data, and room for more in-depth analysis.

If you'd like to contribute, either edit a postmortem file in the data folder, or try to fix an issue.
